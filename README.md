# Address Book [es2015]
### This app was built to allow the users to manage the contact details. Some of the features are:
    - Ability to add new contacts
    - View a list of existing contacts
    - Material design that allows ease of navigation

## Technology Stack
This a web-based application. This means the user would need to access this from a browser. The application consists of a user interface built with HTML with Taiwind CSS library used for styling. The logic is written using vanilla Javascript with no additional libraries.

We have some acceptance tests (also known as end-to-end testing) done while building this application.
